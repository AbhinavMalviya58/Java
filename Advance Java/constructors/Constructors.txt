			Constructors

Constructor is a member function of a class

The name of constructor is same as the name of the class.

Constructor has no return type.

			Constructor is special

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called implicitly, just after the memory is allocated for the object

It is not mandatory for the coder to write a constructor for the class

When there is no constructor defined in the class by programmer, compiler implicitly provide a default constructor for the class.

			Constructor Overloading

Constructors can be overloaded
