Java collection framework, is a fancy way of saying that we have a bunch of cool tools to help us store and organize our data in Java.

Think of it like a toolbox - you have all these different tools to help you with different tasks, like a hammer for pounding nails or a screwdriver for tightening screws. Similarly, the collection framework provides us with different data structures to help us with different tasks.

The Java collection framework has different types of containers like List, Set, and Map. Each container has its own unique properties. For example, if we need to store a bunch of elements and want to access them in a particular order, we can use a List. If we want to store elements in a way that ensures uniqueness, we can use a Set and If we want to store key-value pairs, we can use a Map.

We'll learn more about List, Set, and Map Interface in lessons coming up next.
